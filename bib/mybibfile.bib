abstract = {In pursuit of a more efficient shopping experience, consumers are using a growing combination of distribution channels, in what has come to be known as omnichannel behaviour. Greater understanding of this phenomenon could aid retailers in managing consumer contact points more efficiently. Using distribution services and channel policies, among other key variables, this paper aims to arrive at a conceptual definition of omnichannel behaviour that will enable firms to implement more effective customer segmentation. Methodologically, it is an empirical study based on an online survey of the customers of a global fast fashion chain. The key channel characteristics in this segmentation are found to be the assurance of product delivery and privacy policy. The majority of users of both the offline and online channels are women, younger, more innovative in channel usage and do most of their shopping online.},

The authors also propose a framework that shows the linkages among these challenges and provides a means to conceptu-alize the field of multichannel customer management. A review of academic research reveals that this field has expe-rienced significant research growth, but the growth has not been distributed evenly across the five major challenges.},

abstract = {One of the most important recent advances in business thinking is the recognition that people, in their purchase decision-making, respond to more than simply the tangible product or service being offered. The tangible product, a pair of shoes, a refrigerator, a haircut, or a meal, is only a small part of the total consumption package. Buyers respond to the total product. It includes the services, warranties, packaging, advertising, financing, pleasantries, images, and other features that accompany the product. One of the most significant features of the total product is the place where it is bought or consumed. In some cases, the place, more specifically the atmosphere of the place, is more influential than the product itself in the purchase decision. In some cases, the atmosphere is the primary product. Businessmen, however, have tended to neglect atmosphere as a marketing tool. This is due to two factors. First, men of business tend to be practical and functional in their thinking; if they were poetic they probably would not be businessmen. Secondly, atmospheres are a "silent language" in communication.},

With vertical menus, users needed less eye fixations, were faster and more successful. We conclude that, firstly, vertical menus fit better to perception and cognition than dynamic menus, where the navigation items are hidden and must be accessed by an additional mouse click. Secondly, navigation systems should be extended with different kinds of navigation items adapted to the complexity of the users' navigation tasks, because users tend to switch their navigation strategy when confronted with complex tasks. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Anyone who has signed up for cell phone service, attempted to claim a rebate, or navigated a call center has probably suffered from a company's apparent indifference to what should be its first concern: the customer experiences that culminate in either satisfaction or disappointment and defection. Customer experience is the subjective response customers have to direct or indirect contact with a company. It encompasses every aspect of an offering: customer care, advertising, packaging, features, ease of use, reliability. Customer experience is shaped by customers' expectations, which largely reflect previous experiences. Few CEOs would argue against the significance of customer experience or against measuring and analyzing it. But many don't appreciate how those activities differ from CRM or just how illuminating the data can be. For instance, the majority of the companies in a recent survey believed they have been providing "superior" experiences to customers, but most customers disagreed. The authors describe a customer experience management (CEM) process that involves three kinds of monitoring: past patterns (evaluating completed transactions), present patterns (tracking current relationships), and potential patterns (conducting inquiries in the hope of unveiling future opportunities). Data are collected at or about touch points through such methods as surveys, interviews, focus groups, and online forums. Companies need to involve every function in the effort, not just a single customer-facing group. The authors go on to illustrate how a cross-functional CEM system is created. With such a system, companies can discover which customers are prospects for growth and which require immediate intervention.},

Customers now interact with firms through myriad touch points in multiple channels and media, and customer experiences are more social in nature. These changes require firms to integrate multiple business functions, and even external partners, in creating and delivering positive customer experiences. In this article, the authors aim to develop a stronger understanding of customer experience and the customer journey in this era of increasingly complex customer behavior. To achieve this goal, they examine existing definitions and conceptualizations of customer experience as a construct and provide a historical perspective of the roots of customer experience within marketing. Next, they attempt to bring together what is currently known about customer experience, customer journeys, and customer experience management. Finally, they identify critical areas for future research on this important topic.},

A conceptual model is developed based on a review of existing findings and tested with a large sample of consumers who responded to a questionnaire after navigating through an existing pharmaceutical web site. Structural equations modeling was used to test 10 major hypotheses. Among the key findings, all atmospherics cues were impacting the other constructs, with the central cues mostly affecting site involvement and exploratory behavior, while entertainment affected site involvement and site attitudes.

abstract = {Building on the recent work in web atmospherics, the theoretical notions of psychological reactance and the flow experience, propositions and a model are developed, which provide a framework in which the navigational atmosphere of a web site can be examined. This paper specifically examines how and why consumers are influenced by restrictive navigation cues on the web. Essentially, the present author proposes that restrictive navigational cues act as barriers that threaten consumers' control over web navigation, which, in turn, arouses psychological reactance and leads to negative consequences for the web marketer. These negative consequences include increased levels of negative emotions, negative attitudes toward the web site and increased site avoidance behavior. The magnitude of the threat to control, consumers' expectation of control and the importance of web navigation are proposed to moderate this relationship. The reduction in navigational control associated with restrictive navigation cues is also posited to reduce the likelihood of the consumer flow experience, which, in turn, leads to negative attitudes and site avoidance behavior. Implications for web marketers and avenues for future research are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To address the lack of systematic research on the nature and effectiveness of online retailing, a conceptual model is proposed which examines the potential influence of atmospheric qualities of a virtual store. The underlying premise is that, given the demonstrated impact of store environment on shopper behaviors and outcomes in a traditional retailing setting, such atmospheric cues are likely to play a role in the online shopping context. A Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework is used as the basis of the model which posits that atmospheric cues of the online store, through the intervening effects of affective and cognitive states, influence the outcomes of online retail shopping in terms of approach/avoidance behaviors. Two individual traits, involvement and atmospheric responsiveness, are hypothesized to moderate the relationship between atmospheric cues and shoppers' affective and cognitive reactions. Propositions are derived and the research implications of the model are presented.},

abstract = {This study tests the Mehrabian-Russell environmental psychology model in retail settings. The results suggest that store atmosphere, engendered by the usual myriad of in-store variables, is represented psychologically by consumers in terms of two major emotional states--pleasure and arousal--and that these two emotional stales are significant mediators of intended shopping behaviors within the store. The practical value of this approach is that retailers may be better able to explain and predict the effects of in-store changes on shopping behavior. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Data were collected through a mail survey to computer users who resided in 15 U.S. metropolitan areas. Two-stage structural equation modeling was employed to test hypotheses. The results show that intention to use the Internet to search for information was not only the strongest predictor of Internet purchase intention but also mediated relationships between purchasing intention and other predictors (i.e., attitude toward Internet shopping, perceived behavioral control, and previous Internet purchase experience). Direct and indirect relationships between two antecedents (attitude toward Internet shopping and previous Internet purchase experience) and Internet purchase intention were also found. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.},

abstract = {Since the advent and rapid diffusion of the Internet, the subject of consumer channel choice has attracted a large amount of research, mainly focused on the influence of channel, consumer and product category characteristics as its drivers. The interaction between channel choice and the purchase situation has been largely ignored, however. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap by identifying the key purchase situation variables and conducting an experiment to assess their impact on the choice between the traditional retail outlet and the online store. The results show that the key determinants of channel choice relate to time and distance. Distance-to-store and time pressures are among the factors affecting the probability of online purchase. Using a conceptual framework to explore differences in the impact of situational variables across product categories (high/low involvement, search/experience good), we show that distance-to-store has more influence on the likelihood of online purchase in situations involving search goods, while social variables are found to play a role only in the context of high-involvement goods. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we examine two of the most important themes in flow research in the last decade: the conceptualization and measurement of flow in online environments and the marketing outcomes of flow. In addition, while the unique characteristics of the Internet contributed to our belief that flow was an important construct for understanding consumer use of the Web in 1996, the environment of the Web itself has changed radically over the past decade. Thus, we consider the current context of the Internet, including virtual worlds, for the role and application of the flow construct, as well as important related constructs that will be useful for understanding compelling experiences in the contemporary online environment. {\textcopyright} 2008 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.},

abstract = {Online shopping is becoming one of the most popular applications on the Internet. Websites are the important interfaces in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). Website design significantly affects online shopping behavior. This research used eye-tracker to track the eye-movement process for 42 college students when they were surfing websites with different levels of complexity and completing simple and complex tasks respectively. The study examines how website complexity and task complexity jointly affect users' visual attention and behavior due to different cognitive loads. The study fills a research gap by examining this phenomenon from the cognitive load perspective and taking the moderate effect of task complexity into consideration. The results show that task complexity can moderate the effect of website complexity on users' visual attention and behavior. Specifically, when users conducted a simple task, fixation count and task completion time were at the highest level on the website with high complexity, while fixation duration was not significantly different on the websites with different complexity. However, when users conducted a complex task on a website with medium complexity, task completion time, fixation count, and fixation duration were all at their highest level. The load theory of attention was used to provide the explanation for the results. The findings provide guidelines for website managers and designers to maximize users' visual attention. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

    abstract = { The first stage in the consumer buying process is generally recognised to be that of the information search. This stage is recognised to be an important phase during which promotional messages should reach the intending consumer. Like many other stages of the buying process information seeking becomes more structured and constrained in the eâ€shopping environment. In particular, the ability to collect product information and make comparisons between the different product offerings from different providers, possibly across national and currency boundaries, is often viewed as one of the main competitive challenges of eâ€shopping. This article first visits models of the consumer buying process. It then explores the two approaches to information seeking, browsing and directed searching, and then proceeds to identify the tools that support these approaches. The complexity of variety in these tools is explored, in order to set the scene for understanding the complexity of the options with which the shopper is confronted. }

The results provide support for the notion that animated banner ads prompt better advertising effects than do static ads. Animated banner advertising has better attention-grabbing capabilities, and generates higher recall, more favorable Aad, and higher click-through intention than static ads. Furthermore, an individual's product involvement moderates the effects of animated banner advertising on recall, Aad, and click-through intention. However, the study does not provide solid evidence of the feasibility of the traditional hierarchical model (Cognition -> Affect -> Behavior) in the online banner advertising environment.

abstract = {Interactive online media are an increasingly preferred format for users and advertisers, and skippable online video advertisements are common on social media networks such as YouTube. The specific features and influences of this interactive marketing tool demand further consideration. Focusing on effective tactics, this article investigates the influence of introducing high-arousal and low-arousal stimuli on skippable ad effectiveness (i.e., ad acceptance, ad attitude, brand attitude, and ad intrusiveness), with the potential moderation of context congruency and product involvement. A pretest and three studies confirm that high-arousal ads are watched for longer time and are more effective in congruent contexts. Users' product involvement determines the intrusiveness of high- and low-arousal skippable ads. These findings, along with their practical implications for this novel setting, provide further directions for research too.},

Unfortunately, click-through rates have plummeted. This decline prompts two critical questions: (1) Why do banner ads seem to be ineffective and (2) what can advertisers do to improve their effectiveness? To address these questions, we utilized an eye-tracking device to investigate online surfers' attention to online advertising. Then we conducted a large-scale survey of Internet users' recall, recognition, and awareness of banner advertising. Our research suggests that the reason why click-through rates are low is that surfers actually avoid looking at banner ads during their online activities. This implies that the larger part of a surfer's processing of banners will probably be done at the pre-attentive level. If such is the case, click-through rate is an ineffective measure of banner ad performance. Our research also shows that banner ads do have an impact on traditional memory- The authors would like to thank Voil{\`{a}} and France Telecom for funding this research and Philippe Taupin for his help with the Eye-Tracker device. based measure of effectiveness. Thus, we claim that advertisers should rely more on traditional brand equity measures such as brand awareness and advertising recall. Using such measures, we show that repetition affects unaided advertising recall, brand recognition, and brand awareness and that a banner's message influences both aided advertising recall and brand recognition.},

abstract = {Users faced with Web sites containing many possibly relevant pages often have a decision to make about navigation: use the menu of links or use the provided site search function. Two studies were conducted to examine what users do when faced with this decision on e-commerce Web sites, and how users go about deciding which method to attempt. An exploratory study revealed a wide distribution of searching and browsing behavior across sites and users. Counter to some predictions, use of the site search functions did not yield faster or more accurate performance in locating products. Questionnaire data suggested that factors relevant to the menu structure, interface element prominence, information scent and user dispositions all influenced the decision of whether to browse or search a site for a product. A second experiment utilizing novel e-commerce sites and allowing for more control of factors found to be important in the first study found that browsing behavior was influenced by both the breadth and information scent of the menus. These results suggest that providing site search should not be used to compensate for poor menu design, and provide further evidence regarding the design of effective menu structures.},

With the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as the theoretical foundation, this paper proposes that website design quality is a multi-dimensional construct with a higher-order structure that, when successfully incorporated into the UTAUT model, outperforms existing models. Results are based on a survey of 216 users of internet banking. Findings indicate that the technical, general content and appearance dimensions of a website are most important for users. These dimensions are significantly related to usage behavior directly and indirectly. A halo effect may influence overall evaluation of a website because the dimensions of website design quality are interrelated. The implication is that improvements to the appearance of a website should enhance the overall evaluation of the site, leading to greater usage intentions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Many studies have proposed new website evaluation frameworks and criteria. We have attempted to understand and improve website evaluation through the analysis of 83 articles by classifying them into IS, marketing, and combined-approaches. Our findings showed that most early studies adopted the IS-approach but that later ones (after the burst of the dot-com bubble) shifted to a combined-approach. Our study also revealed that most papers analyzed the evaluation factors via a ranking list. Our review showed that most studies conducted user-based surveys to examine a website, but that very few addressed strategic issues of website evaluation. We therefore proposed a strategic framework as an internal evaluation to ensure consistency between web strategy and actual website presence. The framework involved analysis of web strategy and a hybrid approach that included evaluation during three transaction phases; the framework was designed to be applied by a specific website vis-{\'{a}}-vis its goals and objectives through a five-stage evaluation process. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Publisher Summary
The information that a driver uses is predominantly visual, and wide ranges of specific driving behaviors, from navigation to anticipation of hazardous events, are primarily dependent on the optimum deployment of attention through overt eye movements. Essentially, eye movements consist of two primary events: fixations and saccades. Fixations are periods of relative stability, during which the eyes focus on something in the visual scene. Saccades are rapid, ballistic jumps of the eye that separate the fixations and serve to orient the focus of the eyes from one point of interest to another. The simplest conception of whether an individual has looked at a certain object in a scene is whether the eye coordinates recorded by an eye tracker are coincident with the world coordinates of the object. This can be calculated automatically for eye movements to static images, where the precise coordinates of an object are easily defined and related to the eye position coordinates. Many eye tracking software packages allow areas of interest (AOIs) to be generated for particular pictures, which allow automatic calculation of when individuals look at specific objects. These AOIs are regions of a visual image that are defined by two-dimensional (2D) coordinates in the viewing plane and thus allow the software to identify fixations that fall within their boundaries.},

abstract = {Reviewing 60 studies on natural gaze behavior in sports, it becomes clear that, over the last 40 years, the use of eye-tracking devices has considerably increased. Specifically, this review reveals the large variance of methods applied, analyses performed, and measures derived within the field. The results of sub-sample analyses suggest that sports-related eye-tracking research strives, on the one hand, for ecologically valid test settings (i.e., viewing conditions and response modes), while on the other, for experimental control along with high measurement accuracy (i.e., controlled test conditions with high-frequency eye-trackers linked to algorithmic analyses). To meet both demands, some promising compromises of methodological solutions have been proposed-in particular, the integration of robust mobile eye-trackers in motion-capture systems. However, as the fundamental trade-off between laboratory and field research cannot be solved by technological means, researchers need to carefully weigh the arguments for one or the other approach by accounting for the respective consequences. Nevertheless, for future research on dynamic gaze behavior in sports, further development of the current mobile eye-tracking methodology seems highly advisable to allow for the acquisition and algorithmic analyses of larger amounts of gaze-data and further, to increase the explanatory power of the derived results.},

The pictorial is superior in capturing attention, independent of its size. The text element best captures attention in direct proportion to its surface size.

abstract = {As with all forms of advertising, exposure is a necessary prerequisite for In-ternet banner ad effectiveness. However, exposure does not guarantee a user's attention, an issue especially relevant to the Internet, where ad avoidance occurs most frequently. And if an ad is noticed, the message may or may not remain in the consumer's memory after cognitive processing. However, even if the advertising message is not consciously remembered, the exposure can be unconsciously processed and subsequently change the user's affective state. To investigate how attention levels influence users, this study uses eye tracking to measure the level of attention that results from an advertisement exposure and explores how different levels of attention influence users in conscious and unconscious ways. Also, we examine the effect of animation—one of the most popular attention-grabbing tools—on attention and how it moderates cognitive processing. By measuring and analyzing users' actual eye-movement data, we found that animation in banner ads not only attracts less attention than static ads but also reduces the positive effect of attention on memory. In addition, although more than half of the participants could not recognize the advertised brand, the animated banner ad was unconsciously processed and did influence attitudes toward the brand. The results suggest that animation in banner ads does not necessarily increase user attention, but that even if a user does not consciously notice a banner ad, the user's attitude toward the brand is influenced.},

abstract = {Generation Y (age 18-31) is a very large and economically powerful generation, containing eighty-two million people and spending $200 billion annually. It is not surprising that companies are interested in gaining the patronage of this group, particularly via the web. Surprisingly, very little research into making web pages appealing to this important demographic has been done. This paper addresses this need through two separate studies. The first, an online survey, provides evidence that our proposed score for predicting the visual appeal of web pages reflects the self report measure of what pages Generation Y likes. To refine these findings, an eye tracking study is conducted using the pages that were most and least liked in Study I. Participants' eye movement is tracked while browsing these pages, providing evidence of what attracts their attention. The results of these two studies suggest that Generation Y may prefer pages that include a main large image, images of celebrities, little text, and a search feature.

The results show that a schematic display of textual information improves perceptions of information quality. When a picture of the product appears together with textual information, users remember more information and consider it easier to remember if that information appears schematically. However, without a product picture, users allocate more resources to process paragraph information and therefore recall more information and perceive it as easier to recall. The degrees of familiarity also have important directional effects on these relationships. Adapted from the source document.},

abstract = {As the Web becomes more popular, the interest in effective navigation is increasing. Menu design is becoming a central issue of human computer interface design as the focus of computer applications moves from the computer as a machine to the human as a user. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of three different Web menu designs (a simple selection menu, a global and local navigation menu, and a pull-down menu) on users' information-seeking performance and attitudes. Three Cyber-shopping mall Web sites were developed for the experiment. These Web sites had the same content and a constant information structure, but each had a different menu design. The results showed different effect of menu design on both searching performance and browsing performance. More specifically, participants' searching performance was superior in the pull-down menu condition compared to the global and local navigation menu and the simple selection menu conditions. Browsing task performance was the fastest with the global and local navigation menu. However, there were no significant differences among three menu designs in terms of users' perception on appeal of the Web site and disorientation.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel approach for collecting and processing data originated by web user ocular movements on a web page, which are captured by using an eye-tracking tool. These data allow knowing the exact web user's eye position on a computer screen, and by combining them with the sequence of web page visits registered in the web log, significant insights about his/her behavior within a website can be extracted. With this approach, we can improve the effectiveness of the current methodology for identifying the most important web objects from the web user's point of view, also called Website Keyobjects. It takes as input the website's logs, the pages that compose it and the interest of users in the web objects of each page, which is quantified by means of a survey. Subsequently, the data are transformed and preprocessed before finally applying web mining algorithms that allow the extraction of the Website Keyobjects. With the utilization of the eye-tracking technology, we can eliminate the survey by using a more precise and objective tool to achieve an improvement in the classification of the Website Keyobjects. It was concluded that eye-tracking technology is useful and accurate when it comes to knowing what a user looks at and therefore, what attracts their attention the most. Finally, it was established that there is an improvement between 15% and 20% when using the information generated by the eye tracker. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Wedel2000,
abstract = {The number of brands in the marketplace has vastly in- creased in the 1980s and 1990s, and the amount of money spent on advertising has run parallel. Print advertising is a major communication instrument for advertisers, but print media have become cluttered with advertisements for brands. Therefore, it has become difficult to attract and keep consumers' attention. Advertisements that fail to gain and retain consumers' attention cannot be effective, but attention is not sufficient: Advertising needs to leave durable traces of brands in memory. Eye movements are eminent indicators of visual attention. However, what is currently missing in eye movement research is a serious account of the processing that takes place to store information in long-term memory. We attempt to provide such an account through the devel- opment of a formal model. We model the process by which eye fixations on print advertisements lead to memory for the advertised brands, using a hierarchical Bayesian model, but, rather than postulating such a model as a mere data-analysis tool, we derive it from substantive theory on attention and memory. The model is calibrated to eye-movement data that are collected during exposure of subjects to ads in magazines, and subsequent recognition of the brand in a perceptual memory task. During exposure to the ads we record the fre- quencies of fixations on three ad elements; brand, pictorial and text and, during the memory task, the accuracy and la- tency of memory. Thus, the available data for each subject consist of the frequency of fixations on the ad elements and the accuracy and the latency of memory. The model that we develop is grounded in attention and memory theory and describes information extraction and accumulation during ad exposure and their effect on the accuracy and latency of brand memory. In formulating it, we assume that subjects have different eye-fixation rates for the different ad elements, because of which a negative binomial model of fixation fre- quency arises, and we specify the influence of the size of the ad elements. It is assumed that the number of fixations, not their duration, is related to the amount of information a con- sumer extracts from an ad. The information chunks extracted at each fixation are assumed to be random, varying across MARKETING SCIENCE C) 2000 INFORMS Vol. 19, No. 4, Fall 2000, pp. 297-312 ads and consumers, and are estimated from the observed data. The accumulation of information across multiple fixa- tions to the ad elements in long-term memory is assumed to be additive. The total amount of accumulated information that is not directly observed but estimated using our model influences both the accuracy and latency of subsequent brand memory. Accurate memory is assumed to occur when the accumulated information exceeds a threshold that varies ran- domly across ads and consumers in a binary probit-type of model component. The effect of two media-planning vari- ables, the ad's serial position in a magazine and the ad's lo- cation on the double page, on the brand memory threshold are specified. We formulate hypotheses on the effects of ad element surface, serial position, and location. The model is applied in a study involving a sample of 88 consumers who were exposed to 65 print ads appearing in their natural context in two magazines. The frequency of eye fixations was recorded for each consumer and advertisement with infrared eye-tracking methodology. In a subsequent in- direct memory task, consumers identified the brands from pixelated images of the ads. Across the two magazines, fix- ations to the pictorial and the brand systematically promote accurate brand memory, but text fixations do not. Brand sur- face has a particularly prominent effect. The more informa- tion is extracted from an ad during fixations, the shorter the latency of brand memory is. We find a systematic recency effect: When subjects are exposed to an ad later, they tend to identify it better. In addition, there is a small primacy effect. The effect of the ad's location on the right or left of the page depends on the advertising context. We show how the model supports advertising planning and testing and offer recom- mendations for further research on the effectiveness of brand communication. In future research the model may be ex- tended to accommodate the effects of repeated exposure to ads, to further detail the representation of strength and as- sociation of memory, and to include the effects of creative tactics and media planning variables beyond the ones we included in the present study.},

This is the main conclusion of an analysis of 1363 print advertisements tested with infrared eye-tracking methodology on more than 3600 con-sumers. The pictorial is superior in capturing attention, independent of its size. The text element best captures attention in direct proportion to its surface size. The brand element most effectively transfers attention to the other elements. Only increments in the text element's surface size produce a net gain in attention to the advertisement as a whole.

A unified model-building strategy for both linear and nonlinear models is presented and applied to the analysis of over 20 real datasets from a wide variety of areas, including pharmacokinetics, agriculture, and manufacturing. A strong emphasis is placed on the use of graphical displays at the various phases of the model-building process, starting with exploratory plots of the data and concluding with diagnostic plots to assess the adequacy of a fitted model. Over 170 figures areincluded in the book. The NLME package for analyzing mixed-effects models in R and S-PLUS, developed by the authors, provides the underlying software for implementing the methods presented in the text, being described and illustrated in detail throughout the book. The balanced mix of real data examples, modeling software, and theory makes this book a useful reference for practitioners using mixed-effects models in their data analyses. It can also be used as a text for a one-semester graduate-level applied course in mixed-effects models. Researchers in statistical computing will also find this book appealing for its presentation of novel and efficient computational methods for fitting linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models.

abstract = {Three studies were conducted to ascertain how quickly people form an opinion about web page visual appeal. In the first study, participants twice rated the visual appeal of web homepages presented for 500ms each. The second study replicated the first, but participants also rated eachweb page on seven specific design dimensions.Visual appealwas found to be closely related to most of these. Study 3 again replicated the 500ms condition as well as adding a 50ms condition using the same stimuli to determine whether the first impression may be interpreted as a ‘mere exposure effect' (Zajonc 1980). Throughout, visual appeal ratings were highly correlated from one phase to the next as were the correlations between the 50ms and 500ms conditions. Thus, visual appeal can be assessed within 50ms, suggesting that web designers have about 50 ms to make a good first impression.},

abstract = {The authors address two key issues that have received inadequate attention in the choice behavior literature on variety seeking. First, they explicitly separate true variety-seeking behavior (i.e., intrinsically motivated) from derived varied behavior (i.e., extrinsically motivated). Second, they hypothesize variety-seeking behavior to be a function of the individual difference characteristic of need for variety and product category-level characteristics that interact to determine the situations in which variety seeking is more likely to occur relative to repeat purchasing and derived varied behavior. The authors test their hypotheses in a field study of Dutch consumers, which assesses both the intensity of brand switching and the underlying motives for their switching behavior. Results support the importance of isolating variety switches from derived switches and of considering product category-level factors as an explanation for the occurrence of variety-seeking behavior.},

abstract = {Includes index. Publisher Fact Sheet Argues that attention is the scarcest element in today's economy, & provides a comprehensive picture of attention & its implications for business, organizations, & individuals. Annotation In today's information flooded world the scarcest resource is people's attention. This book argues that unless companies learn to capture, manage and keep it, they'll fall behind. Annotation. Annotation Trillions of documents circulate in U.S. offices annually. Internet traffic doubles every hundred days. Approximately two hundred messages flood managers' desktops daily. Welcome to the attention economy, in which the new scarcest resource isn't ideas or even talent, but attention itself. This groundbreaking book argues that today's businesses are headed for disaster-unless they can overcome the dangerously high attention deficits that threaten to cripple today's workplace. Accenture consultants and academics Thomas Davenport and John Beck explain that the problems for businesspeople lie on both sides of the attention equation: on getting and holding the attention of information-flooded employees, consumers, and stockholders, and on parceling out their own attention in the face of overwhelming options. The resolution: learn to manage this critical yet finite resource, or fail. Drawing from compelling research, the authors outline four perspectives on attention management that are critical to understanding its impact on business: (1) measuring and allocating attention, (2) understanding and leveraging its psychological dimensions, (3) mastering new streamlining technologies, and (4) adapting lessons from traditional attention industries like advertising. Using these perspectives, the authors shine new light on critical business areas including e-commerce, organizational leadership, information and knowledge management, and strategy. Attention management can be applied to help companies improve talent motivation and retention, avoid employee burnout, win customer loyalty on the Web, more effectively sell products and services, impress investors and analysts, and more. The authors also introduce a revolutionary measurement tool, the AttentionScape, that can help diagnose attention distribution problems, determine how the company is directing employees' attention, and analyze the attention the company is getting from customers. The first book to explore the burgeoning attention economy and outline a plan for how organizations must operate within it, this landmark work details how to earn and spend the new currency of business. 1.

The objective is to investigate how consumers gather product and attribute information from moment to moment. We propose a hierarchical hidden Markov model that consists of three connected layers: a lower layer that describes the eye movements, a middle layer that identifies information acquisition processes, and an upper layer that captures strategy switching. The proposed model accounts for the data better than several alternative models. The results show that consumers switch frequently between acquisition strategies, and they obtain information on only two or three attributes or products in a particular acquisition strategy before switching. Horizontal and contiguous eye movements play an important role in information acquisition. Furthermore, our results shed new light on the phenomenon of gaze cascades during choice. We discuss the implications for Web design, online retailing, and new directions for research on online choice.},

abstract = {Using eye-tracking field experiments, we examine the dynamics underlying consumers' attention-allocation behaviors in online search, with focus on attention adjustment, attention renewal, and equilibrium seeking. In particular, we probed into how consumers' e-commerce search behaviors vary when they are exposed to an advertisement during a search and when they are not. The findings from the two separate experiments suggest that consumers' attention span decreases exponentially, instead of linearly, as they maneuver from the top to the bottom of a search result webpage. The total number of available options significantly influences the speed and pattern of attention decay. However, attention decay does not simply move in the direction of depletion but can be refreshed and renewed upon encountering attention-diverting ad stimuli. Although ad stimuli are often consid- ered distracting and worthless, they can produce positive effects when positioned in the middle of a search results listing, where a consumer's attention resources are rejuvenated by ads. Finally, because of consumers' propensity to seek equilibrium, attention decay occurs more rapidly after, rather than before, attention renewal. We extend the literature on the mere categorization effect by investigating how ad stimuli structurally separate search choices into mental categories and diminish ongoing attention decay patterns.},

abstract = {A feature central to the success of e-commerce Web sites is the design of an effective interface to present product information. However, the suitability of the prevalent information formats in supporting various online shopping tasks is not known. Using the cognitive fit theory as the theoretical framework, we developed a research model to investigate the fit between information format and shopping task, and examine its influence on consumers' online shopping performance and perceptions of shopping experience. The competition for attention theory from the marketing literature and the scanpath theory from vision research were employed to support the analyses. An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of two types of information formats (list versus matrix) in the context of two types of shopping tasks (searching versus browsing). The results show that when there is a match between the information format and the shopping task, consumers can search the information space more efficiently and have better recall of product information. Specifically, the list format better supports browsing tasks, and the matrix format facilitates searching tasks. However, a match between the information format and the shopping task has no effect on cognitive effort or attitude toward using the Web site. Overall, this research supports the application of the cognitive fit theory to the study of Web interface design. It also demonstrates the value in integrating findings from cognitive science and vision research to understand the processes involved. As the information format has been shown to affect consumers' online shopping behavior, even when the information content is held constant, the practical implications for Web site designers include providing both types of information format on their Web sites and matching the appropriate information format to the individual consumer's task.

Collecting 506 valid respondents of agricultural product consumers in social commerce, we utilized SmartPLS to conduct statistical analysis for the model. The empirical results indicate that interactivity, recommendations, and feedback exert positive effects on swift guanxi and trust to different degrees. In turn, swift guanxi and trust enable and mediate the prediction of consumer repurchase intention in social commerce context.

abstract = {The use of social media can have positive effects on users, but it may also bring about negative perceptions in varying degrees of enormity. This study investigates the negative consequences of high Facebook usage for different purposes. It focuses on how the social, cognitive, and hedonic uses of Facebook induce stress and exhaustion, thereby influencing an individual's intention to voluntary quit from using Facebook. The stimulus-organism-response paradigm is used in this study to examine the antecedents of intentions to discontinue the use of Facebook. The distinctive stimuli, organisms, and response in the proposed research model are empirically investigated through a sample of 360 Facebook users. Findings indicate that psychological and behavioral consequences compel users to discontinue or reduce the use of Facebook due to exhaustion and technostress caused by social networking sites (SNS). The excessive social, hedonic, and cognitive uses of Facebook are also sources of technostress, and the subsequent SNS exhaustion results in the decision to quit Facebook. This study draws theoretical implications for future SNS research as well as practical implications for organizations and SNS providers and users. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this study, an online experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of a warm hue - yellow versus a cool hue - blue of the background and used a self-administered online survey for data collection. The results underscore the important role online store color plays in creating the flow experience and revealed that blue hue induces more flow than yellow. The two dimensions of flow (perceived enjoyment and concentration) have direct and mediating effects on purchase intention and revisit intention. Concentration, but not enjoyment, has direct and mediating effects on the number of viewed pages and time spent per visit. This research enhances our understanding of the relationship between online store atmospheric color and flow and highlights the role of flow as an extension of SOR model applied online. Other theoretical and managerial implications of the results are discussed. Finally, suggestions regarding future research are presented.},

abstract = {With the vigorous development of applications (App), graphical user interfaces (GUI) have been widely found in computers and handheld devices. This study aimed to explore the relationships between different presentation modes of graphical icons and users' attention. An eye tracker was employed to measure each participant's experimental data; in addition, subjective evaluation of attention was conducted. Thus, the optimum presentation mode attracting the most attention might be determined. The experiment was designed to investigate two variables: icon composition and background. Through permutation and combination, six presentation modes were obtained as follows: line + positive background (M1), plane + positive background (M2), line + negative background (M3), plane + negative background (M4), line + no background (M5), and plane + no background (M6). Thirty-six participants were requested to view thirty stimuli, or the contour drawings of graphical icons, presented simultaneously in six modes mentioned above. The participants' fixation duration, fixation frequency, and subjective evaluation of attention were analyzed through two-way ANOVA. The analytical results showed that in terms of the three performance indicators above, M4 performed the best among the six presentation modes. Moreover, regarding icon composition, planes performed better than lines in terms of the three performance indicators. As for background, negative background performed the best in terms of the three performance indicators, positive background ranked second, and no background performed the worst. The findings can serve as a reference when icons are researched or designed in the future.},

abstract = {The “gaze bias theory” suggests that people tend to look longer at items that are eventually chosen. This was not entirely confirmed for food choice, a complex phenomenon influenced by many factors. Although it has been shown that health-related primes affect both consumer attention and choice, the effect of unhealthy body shape primes on these outcomes is largely unknown. Therefore, we here investigated how body primes, namely normal weight (NW), severely overweight (OW) and severely underweight (UW) body shapes, influenced attention and choice for low-calorie food (LcFd) and high-calorie food (HcFd). We hypothesized that OW and UW primes would activate opposing health goals (weight-loss vs. weight-gain respectively). Fifty normal weight sated females completed a primed food choice task in which choices between a LcFd and HcFd, matched for subjective liking, were presented after control or human body shapes (NW, UW or OW). In each trial participants had to identify the shape (i.e., non-human, human male or human female) and then choose the food they wanted to eat at that moment. Gaze was recorded by an eye tracker. Results showed that, although primes did not influence the choice, the total dwell time on chosen HcFd was higher when preceded by an OW prime compared with chosen LcFd and chosen HcFd preceded by an UW prime. Also, both total dwell time and the number of fixations were higher for chosen food compared with non-chosen food as well as for HcFd compared with LcFd without a corresponding higher proportion of HcFd choice. Overall, these data shed light on the interactions between attention, health body priming and food choice.},

@article{Huang2018a,
abstract = {With the overload of information on the internet today, consumer attention is becoming increasingly precious. Online retailers often use banner advertising for products that consumers have previously viewed so as to achieve retargeting. This study examined the attention that female consumers paid to product-based personalized banner ads for online apparel retailers, and how this attention was influenced by visual content composition and slot position. Using a screen eye tracker, we analyzed the interaction effects of ad slot position (content relevance, top-center or right sidebar slot on portal site) and the content composition (image-text ratio, discount information, use of models) of personalized banner ads on relevant eye movement data. This data allowed for increased understanding of the combinations of ad content/layout composition and slot position that gain the most attention. The results revealed that placing apparel banner ads next to articles associated with apparel and fashion increases the overall amount of attention that consumers give the ad. Furthermore, ads in the top-center slot on portal sites receive greater total contact time and number of fixations than those in the right sidebar. We further found that adding discount information and using models to display the garment in banner ads can effectively increase the total contact time and number of fixations.},

abstract = {Consumers' food purchase behavior is influenced by label information displayed on the product. However, consumers vary in their label knowledge, affecting their individual product quality perception and purchase intent. An eye-tracking is an objective methodology that has been used to analyze consumers' purchase behavior in terms of their visual attention to labels. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of label education on consumers' purchase behavior, measured with respect to their visual attention to label claims on chicken products. Twenty-nine participants with prior food label education were chosen to represent the High Label Understanding (HLU) group. Additionally, 29 new participants without any kind of prior label education were selected as a Control (CNTL) group. Each participant viewed packaging images of chicken meat products using the eye-tracker and answered additional subjective questions relating to their potential purchase behavior (purchase intent, trust in product, and overall liking). Participants in the CNTL group examined the appearance of the meat product more often and longer than did those in the HLU group. In contrast, participants in the HLU group looked at the label claims associated with sustainability and process more often and longer than did those in the CNTL group. Furthermore, participants in the HLU group liked and trusted the chicken products significantly more than did those in the CNTL group. In conclusion, our findings provide empirical evidence that enhanced label-knowledge increases consumers' visual attention to labels with a possibility of translation into positive purchase behavior.},

@article{Castilla2016,
abstract = {The population is gradually aging, but only 4% of elderly people are Internet users. These data indicate the need to take action to bridge this digital divide. Several studies show that learning and memory processes are faster when there is familiarity with the learning object, and the user finds a clear internal correspondence between the previous experience and the current experience. The elderly make up one of the groups most affected by the digital divide, with less Internet access, knowledge, and use. The Internet is by definition an almost infinite structure of hypertext, where the user navigates by using information in an active way, and where the elderly lack previous experience with hypertextual applications. The aim of this study is to test the navigation variable by comparing two designs of the same email Web application with different navigation styles: linear vs hypertextual navigation. The study consisted of usability testing, employing the method of task analysis. Other assessment tools were also used, such as the eye tracker and post-session self-report questionnaires designed ad hoc for this study. A sample of 34 users from 60 to 83 years old and with heterogeneous previous experience with new technologies participated in the study. They performed A/B testing with a counterbalanced within-subject design. The linear navigation condition, compared to the hypertextual condition, obtained a higher success rate, lower performance time, better satisfaction ratings and greater user preference. The main contribution of this study is to demonstrate the relevance of navigation in systems oriented toward the elderly, indicating that linear navigation is more suitable for these users.},

abstract = {To illustrate the differing thoughts and emotions involved in guiding habitual and nonhabitual behavior, 2 diary studies were conducted in which participants provided hourly reports of their ongoing experiences. When participants were engaged in habitual behavior, defined as behavior that had been performed almost daily in stable contexts, they were likely to think about issues unrelated to their behavior, presumably because they did not have to consciously guide their actions. When engaged in nonhabitual behavior, or actions performed less often or in shifting contexts, participants' thoughts tended to correspond to their behavior, suggesting that thought was necessary to guide action. Furthermore, the self-regulatory benefits of habits were apparent in the lesser feelings of stress associated with habitual than nonhabitual behavior.},
